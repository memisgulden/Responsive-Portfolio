            <img id="img" src="images/Gulden Rose Memis.jpg" alt="GuldenRose.jpg"> Hello world! My name is Gulden Rose Memis and I am 
            a new developer excited about this field. I graduated Temple University in 2017 with a degree in Finance. My passions include
            traveling, music, food and rugby. Above all, the thing I love the most is trying new things. I proved this to myself at Temple where,
            without any prior experience in rugby, I decided to join the team. I did not want to join as a player in the back running the ball but as 
            a forward, head-first into the action. Although I got my ass handed to me many, many times there is nothing more exciting then having 
            the ball, running at full speed and taking people down as you go. This head-first-all-or-nothing attitude is how I approach the obstacles 
            that life has thrown my way. This is exactly how I plan on continuing. This passion of delving into "new" is what lead me into this field.
            Although I have no prior background, a career in full-stack development is something that excites me a great deal. I look forward
            to making new programs, solving new problems and working in a new atomosphere. On or off the field I am always ready to run full force.
